# AI-Powered Phishing Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered phishing detection system that can classify emails as either phishing or legitimate (ham). The system leverages machine learning to analyze email text, headers, and embedded URLs to detect malicious content.

## 🚀 Features

- Email Text Classification: Uses NLP techniques to analyze email body and subject.

- Machine Learning-Based Detection: Trains a model to differentiate phishing emails from legitimate ones.

- Threat Intelligence Integration: Checks email links against known phishing databases.

- Security Feature Extraction: Analyzes email headers, sender reputation, and domain history.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

- NLTK / SpaCy (Natural Language Processing)

- Flask / FastAPI (for API deployment)

- PhishTank API (for URL reputation checking)
